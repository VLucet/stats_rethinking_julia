### An exploration with Julia and `Turing.jl`

This repository contains the code required to reproduce (a subset of) the figures in [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) using the Julia package [Turing](https://turing.ml/dev/). Throughout the website, the page number for the coresponding figure are given for the second edition of the book.

This project is an attempt to build upon existing translations of Statistical Rethinking in Julia, such as the packages [StatisticalRethinking.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinking.jl), and actually makes use of the datasets distributed with the package. It is primarily aimed as a way for me to get an introduction to Julia, Turing and Franklin (with which this site is built), but I hope it can serve as a resource for others in the future. 

You are most welcome to contribute [here](https://github.com/VLucet/stats_rethinking_julia).

### By chapter:
